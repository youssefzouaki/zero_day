##Vagrant project##
The concept is using **Vagrant** on my personal computer or coding in my local computer.
In this project I have to:
*Create and setup my **Git** and **GitHub** account.
*Create a file 'README.md' and write a small [Markdown][1] text to present this project.
*Know the role of the cammand 'uname'.
*Type my answer into the '0Ã—00-vagrant' directory.
